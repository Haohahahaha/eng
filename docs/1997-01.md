## Para. 1

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot *parliamentary[^1]* *debates[^2]*, Australia's Northern *Territory[^3]* became the first legal *authority[^4]* in the world to allow doctors to *take the lives[^5]* of *incurably[^6]* ill patients who wish to die. The *measure[^7]* passed by the *convincing[^8]* vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word *flashed[^9]* on the Internet and was *picked up[^10]*, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on *via[^11]* the group's on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: "We posted *bulletins[^12]* all day long, because of course this isn't just something that happened in Australia. It's world history."
